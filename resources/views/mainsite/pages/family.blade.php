                                After you contact us with your care requirements, we'll carefully review your information and uniquely match you with a selection of carers that we believe will be a great fit for you. You'll have the opportunity to review detailed profiles for each carer you're matched with in your account, along with their photo, experience, interests, and what they enjoy about being a carer. You can then confirm which carer you prefer and communicate directly with them using the chat feature or arrange a phone call.

                                We take the vetting of self-employed carers very seriously to ensure the highest quality of care. All carers undergo a thorough screening process, including background checks, interviews, and reference verification. They must also provide proof of qualifications and experience relevant to the care services they offer. Additionally, carers are required to pass our training programs and demonstrate a commitment to compassionate and professional care.

                                Yes. Live-in carers provide personal care, which may include assistance with toileting, washing and bathing, dressing, oral care, grooming, and medication prompting. If your loved one feels uncomfortable receiving help with intimate personal care, it's important to detail the level of support or supervision needed in your care request and profile to ensure the best match.

                                Absolutely. Live-in carers reside in your loved one's home to offer 24-hour care, including nighttime support as needed. They help establish bedtime routines and assist with night-time needs such as toileting, reassurance, and mobility assistance.

                                When a new carer moves in, it may take some time to establish a comfortable routine. Care schedules are personalized to meet individual needs. Typically, a carer stays for about four weeks before taking a break, during which a temporary carer provides respite care. This ensures continuity and familiarity for your loved one.
